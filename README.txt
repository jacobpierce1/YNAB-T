Design goals:


Tasks

- add new tasks
- add subtasks
- view all tasks in table
- hide / show tasks 
- states for task excess: good, bad, none
- show current task in big letters (reinforces idea that this is what the user must work on)
- keyboard shortcut to bring up task selector / rapidly switch task 


Goals 
- independently set daily, weekly, monthly, and custom goals 
- view progress bars / data for goals 
- set default pomodoro for any task / subtask 
- set goal priorities
- choose priority algorithm (none, descending priority, fixed schedule, random + weighted by priority)
  - this will recommend a task but not force you to do it
- only time under an active pomodoro will contribute to goals / tracked time. breaks are tracked separately.



Time management
- set what task you are currently working on
- revise schedule to modify tasks (e.g. wrong task set, pomodoros manually executed while computer off, etc.)
- set task order for the day



Pomodoro
- set default pomodoro for new tasks
- set custom pomodoro for different tasks
- reset custom pomodoro to default
- start pomodoro
- pause pomodoro
- show pomodoro timer in menu bar
- set keyboard shortcut to start / pause pomodoro
- use keyboard shortcut to start / pause pomodoro
- stopwatch mode 
- active pomodoro time (stopwatch or countdown unpaused) updates
- safety for monitor sleep 
- switch task mid-pomodoro
- reset pomodoro timer
- finish pomodoro timer early
- add / subtract custom time
- launch single-use custom pomodoro 
- breaks and extended breaks will be tracked separately. 


Analytics

- view schedule for previous weeks
- tabulate / plot goals and time spent for day, week, month
